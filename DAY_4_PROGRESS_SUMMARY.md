- "Get concessions"

### 3. Intelligent Parameter Extraction

## 💡 Usage Examples

### Single Query Mode
```bash
# Ask a single question
python scripts/nl_query.py "Show me all concessions"

# Find specific clauses
python scripts/nl_query.py "Find liability clauses"

# Track clause history
python scripts/nl_query.py "Track clause 1.1 history"

# Get statistics
python scripts/nl_query.py "How many clauses are there?"
```

### Interactive Mode
```bash
# Start interactive session
python scripts/nl_query.py

# Then ask questions:
❓ Ask a question: Show me all concessions
❓ Ask a question: What did we agree to in round 2?
❓ Ask a question: Find liability clauses
❓ Ask a question: quit
```

## 🎓 Technical Implementation

### Pattern Matching Architecture

**1. Question Normalization**
```python
question_lower = question.lower().strip()
```

**2. Pattern Iteration**
```python
for pattern_dict in self.query_patterns:
    for pattern in pattern_dict["patterns"]:
        match = re.search(pattern, question_lower)
        if match:
            # Extract parameters and return
```

**3. Parameter Extraction**
```python
# From regex groups
params["version"] = int(match.group(1))

# From keyword inference
for term in ["liability", "indemnity", "warrant", ...]:
    if term in question_lower:
        params["keyword"] = term
```

**4. Cypher Generation**
```python
cypher_query = pattern_dict["cypher_template"].format(**params)
```

**5. Query Execution**
```python
result = self.graph.query(cypher_query)
```

**6. Result Formatting**
```python
formatter = pattern_dict.get("formatter", self._format_generic)
formatted_output = formatter(result.result_set, params)
```

### Query Pattern Structure
```python
{
    "patterns": [r"regex1", r"regex2", ...],
    "description": "Human-readable description",
    "cypher_template": "MATCH ... RETURN ... {param}",
    "formatter": self._format_function,
    "requires_params": True
}
```
