```

./launch_ui.sh
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### UI won't load?

1. **Check FalkorDB is running:**
   ```bash
   docker ps | grep falkordb
   ```
   If not: `docker start falkordb`

2. **Check Streamlit is running:**
   ```bash
   ps aux | grep streamlit
   ```

3. **Try accessing directly:**
   Open: http://localhost:8501

### Seeing errors in terminal?

- Most warnings are normal during startup
- As long as "You can now view your Streamlit app in your browser" appears, it's working
- Check http://localhost:8501 - if it loads, you're good!

### Port already in use?

```bash
# Kill existing Streamlit processes
pkill -f streamlit

# Restart
./launch_ui.sh
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

### For Best Visual Impact:

1. **Start with matter_001 visualization** - Shows complete v1→v4 progression
2. **Use "Track clause 1.1 history" query** - Proves multi-version continuity
3. **Show the KPI charts** - Visual proof of 100-400x speedup

### For Interactive Demo:

1. Let your boss type queries themselves
2. Let them drag nodes in the graph visualization
3. Show them the hover tooltips (hover over any node)
4. Let them explore the sidebar statistics

## 🎬 Script for Presenting

**Opening line:**
"Let me show you the interactive interface. This is a web UI where you can explore the Knowledge Graph visually and ask questions in plain English."

**Natural Language Tab:**
"Watch - I'll type my question: 'Show me all concessions'. No special syntax. Results in 2 milliseconds."

**Graph Visualization Tab:**
"Now let's see this visually. I'll generate a graph for matter_001. See these nodes and connections? This is the actual Knowledge Graph. Blue nodes are clauses, green are recommendations. You can drag them, hover for details."

**KPI Tab:**
"Here are the numbers: 100% clause linkage, 1.2ms average queries, 4,166 times faster than our target. And this chart shows recommendations decreasing from 10 to 0 - the system is learning."

**Closing:**
"Everything is interactive. Try any query, explore any matter, see any relationship. This is what Knowledge Graphs enable."
