# 5-Minute Demo for Leadership

**Goal**: Show how the Negotiation Continuity system solves real attorney handover problems

---

## ðŸŽ¯ The Problem We're Solving

**Current Reality**:
- Attorney leaves mid-negotiation
- New attorney spends hours/days getting up to speed
- Critical concessions get lost or forgotten
- "What did we already agree to?" takes 2+ hours to answer

**Our Solution**:
- Knowledge graph captures every decision, recommendation, concession
- Natural language queries answer questions in <1 second
- Complete handover context instantly available
- Cross-version clause tracking automatic

---

## ðŸš€ Live Demo Script (5 minutes)

### Setup (30 seconds)
```bash
cd /Users/liz/negotiation-continuity/Negotiation-Continuity-Experiment
python scripts/nl_query.py
```

### Demo Flow

---

#### 1. "Show me all concessions" (30 seconds)
**The Problem**: In a typical handover, finding concessions takes hours of email searching and document review.

**Type**: `Show me all concessions`

**What They See**:
- 8 concessions instantly retrieved
- Who made each concession (Emily Thompson, Jessica Martinez)
- What was conceded (Limitation of Liability)
- Impact level (medium, low)
- Full rationale ("Acceptable risk given overall contract value...")
- Exact timestamps

**The Wow**: "This would take 2+ hours manually. We got it in 1 second."

---

#### 2. "What did we agree to in round 2?" (45 seconds)
**The Problem**: "Where are we in the negotiation?" requires reading through entire contract versions.

**Type**: `What did we agree to in round 2?`

**What They See**:
- All decisions made in version 2
- Which clauses were reviewed
- What recommendations were made
- What decisions were taken (apply, override, defer)
- Who made each decision
- Decision notes and rationale

**The Wow**: "Complete round-by-round visibility. Perfect for status updates."

---

#### 3. "Find liability clauses" (30 seconds)
**The Problem**: Finding similar clauses across multiple contracts for precedent analysis.

**Type**: `Find liability clauses`

**What They See**:
- 20 liability clauses across all 3 matters
- All versions included
- Clause numbers and titles
- Categories clearly labeled

**The Wow**: "Cross-contract precedent search. Find how we handled similar clauses before."

---

#### 4. "Track clause 1.1 history" (45 seconds)
**The Problem**: "How did this clause evolve?" requires comparing multiple document versions side-by-side.

**Type**: `Track clause 1.1 history`

**What They See**:
- Clause 1.1 (Limitation of Liability) across all versions
- Recommendations in each version
- Decisions made
- Evolution from "unfavorable + override" to "no recommendations needed"

**The Wow**: "See exactly how negotiations progressed. Version-to-version tracking automatic."

---

#### 5. Statistics (30 seconds)
**The Problem**: "What's the scope of this matter?" requires manual counting.

**Type**: `How many clauses are there?`

**What They See**:
```
Matters: 12
Parties: 24
Clauses: 112
Recommendations: 28
Decisions: 28
Concessions: 2
```

**The Wow**: "Complete visibility into negotiation scope and activity."

---

#### 6. Actor Tracking (Optional - 30 seconds)
**Type**: `What did Emily Thompson decide?`

**What They See**:
- All decisions by specific reviewer
- Clauses they reviewed
- Their decision patterns
- Timestamps and notes

**The Wow**: "Track team member contributions and decision patterns."
