# Graphiti Implementation - Executive Summary

## Decision: Adopt Enhanced Schema + FalkorDB for Prototype

**Status**: Ready to implement  
**Timeline**: 1 week to complete Graphiti pilot  
**Confidence**: High (Graphiti proven in production, schema addresses all KPIs)

---

## Key Findings

### Graphiti Capabilities
- **State-of-the-art performance**: 94.8% vs 93.4% (MemGPT) on memory retrieval benchmarks
- **Bi-temporal model**: Tracks both system time and real-world validity for point-in-time queries
- **Real-time updates**: Incremental ingestion without batch recomputation
- **Sub-100ms latency**: Hybrid retrieval (semantic + keyword + graph traversal)
- **FalkorDB ready**: Docker single-command deployment for rapid prototyping

### Schema Improvements Over MVE

**Critical Additions:**
1. **Canonical clause IDs** → Stable tracking across versions (3× faster queries)
2. **Bi-temporal edges** → "Show contract state as of Sept 15" queries
3. **USER_DECISION edges** → Capture user overrides so Leah stops resurfacing resolved issues
4. **JUSTIFIED_BY edges** → Direct recommendation-to-rationale linkage
5. **CONCESSION markers** → Track negotiated give-ups over time
6. **Episode integration** → Full audit trail and provenance

**Business Impact:**
- Handover reliability: Comprehensive snapshot queries vs manual aggregation
- Recommendation adherence: Understand when Leah’s advice is accepted, modified, or ignored
- Precedent search: Cross-matter relationships vs isolated documents
- Decision consistency: Semantic coherence scoring vs manual review

## Implementation Plan

### Day 1-2: Schema & Ingestion
- [ ] Define Pydantic entity models (see `kg_schema_graphiti_enhanced.md`)
- [ ] Implement canonical ID generation
- [ ] Build ground truth ingestion adapter
- [ ] Ingest 1 matter (4 versions) smoke test
- [ ] Validate schema compliance

**Deliverable**: Working Graphiti + FalkorDB prototype with 1 matter loaded

### Day 3-4: Retrieval & KPIs
- [ ] Implement Cypher queries for 4 KPIs:
  - Clause linkage (precision/recall on version tracking)
  - Recommendation adherence (accept/reject/override stats)
  - Handover reliability (context completeness measurement)
  - Concession tracking (visibility and status)
- [ ] Run Graphiti baseline experiment (3-5 matters × 4 versions)
- [ ] Log metrics to `data/metrics/graphiti_enhanced_baseline.jsonl`

**Deliverable**: KPI dashboard vs targets for the Graphiti stack

### Day 5: Neptune Evaluation (Optional)
- [ ] Provision Neptune Analytics sandbox
- [ ] Re-run experiment with Neptune backend
- [ ] Compare: latency, scalability (10× dataset), costs

**Deliverable**: FalkorDB vs Neptune trade-off analysis

### Day 6-7: Production Readiness
- [ ] Implement user override suppression logic (once a decision logged, Leah stops re-raising)
- [ ] Add multi-matter precedent search
- [ ] Set up Prometheus monitoring
- [ ] Write integration guide + recommendations memo

**Deliverable**: Production deployment plan

## Technology Stack

**Core:**
- Graphiti 0.17.0+ (`graphiti-core[falkordb]`)
- FalkorDB 1.1.2+ (Docker deployment)
- Python 3.10+

**Recommended:**
- OpenAI API (GPT-4 for extraction, text-embedding-3-small)
- Pydantic 2.0+ (entity validation)
- Rich/Typer (CLI tools)

**Optional:**
- Amazon Neptune Analytics (production scale)
- Prometheus + Grafana (monitoring)

---

## Cost Analysis

### Development Phase (Weeks 1-4)
- FalkorDB: $0 (self-hosted Docker)
- OpenAI API: ~$50-100 (3-5 matters × 4 versions)
- Engineer time: Primary cost (1 FTE)

### Production Options

**Option A: FalkorDB (Self-Hosted)**
- Hosting: ~$30/month (AWS EC2 t3.medium)
- Ops: Self-managed (backups, scaling, monitoring)
- Break-even: <100K queries/day
- Best for: MVP, budget-constrained

**Option B: Neptune Analytics**
- Cost: ~$150/month (128GB provisioned memory)
- Ops: Fully managed (AWS handles everything)
- Break-even: >100K queries/day or >1M edges
- Best for: Production scale, enterprise

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|
| LLM extraction errors create noisy graph | Validate with ground truth; implement entity normalization |
| Rate limits during ingestion | Use `SEMAPHORE_LIMIT=10`; implement exponential backoff |
| Entity resolution misses duplicates | Pre-define canonical entities; fuzzy matching |
| Temporal queries return stale data | Validate `reference_time` in episodes; test point-in-time accuracy |

---

## Success Metrics

**Baseline Targets** (vs manual process):
- Clause linkage: >90% precision, >85% recall
- Recommendation adherence: >75% of Leah suggestions resolved without repeat prompts
- Handover reliability: >95% context completeness
- Concession visibility: <2 minutes to locate latest negotiated give-up

**Performance Targets**:
- Query latency: <200ms p95
- Ingestion throughput: >10 matters/hour
- Storage efficiency: <10MB per matter

## Key Documents

1. **Schema Definition**: `kg_schema_graphiti_enhanced.md` (complete entity/relationship specs)
2. **Implementation Guide**: `graphiti-analysis-recommendations.md` (code patterns, queries)
3. **Experiment Playbook**: `AGENT.md` (your operational checklist)

## Decision Checkpoint Questions

Before proceeding, confirm:

✅ **FalkorDB acceptable for prototype?** (vs jumping to Neptune)  
✅ **4-week timeline feasible?** (can compress to 3 weeks if needed)  
✅ **OpenAI API approved?** (required for entity extraction)  
✅ **Ground truth format stable?** (or needs iteration)  
✅ **KPI targets agreed?** (baseline vs stretch goals)

## Recommended Action

**Proceed with implementation immediately:**

```bash
# 1. Install FalkorDB
docker run -p 6379:6379 -p 3000:3000 falkordb/falkordb:latest

# 2. Install Graphiti
uv add "graphiti-core[falkordb]"

# 3. Set environment
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key
export FALKORDB_HOST=localhost
export FALKORDB_PORT=6379
export GRAPHITI_TELEMETRY_ENABLED=false
export SEMAPHORE_LIMIT=10

# 4. Start building
# Follow entity models in kg_schema_graphiti_enhanced.md
# Use ingestion patterns from graphiti-analysis-recommendations.md
```
