# OpenAI API Key Required

## Action Needed

Please add your OpenAI API key to the `.env` file.

### Steps:

1. **Get your OpenAI API key:**
   - Go to: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
   - Click "Create new secret key"
   - Copy the key (starts with `sk-proj-...`)

2. **Add to .env file:**
   - Open `.env` in your editor
   - Find the line: `OPENAI_API_KEY=`
   - Paste your key after the `=`
   - Save the file

### Example:
```bash
# Before:
OPENAI_API_KEY=

# After:
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-abcd1234...your_actual_key...xyz
```

### Why is this needed?

Graphiti uses OpenAI's API for:
- Generating embeddings for semantic search
- Entity extraction from text
- Natural language understanding

### What happens next?

Once you've added your API key:
1. Run: `python scripts/test_falkordb_connection.py`
2. If all tests pass, we'll proceed with ingestion
3. If there's an issue, the test script will tell you what's wrong

**Current Status**: FalkorDB is running âœ…, waiting for API key to continue
