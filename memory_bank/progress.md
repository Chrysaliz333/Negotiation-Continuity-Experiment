## Phase 0: Foundation ✅ COMPLETED

### Memory Bank Setup
- ✅ Created `memory_bank/` directory structure
- ✅ Synthesized `projectbrief.md` from existing docs
- ✅ Established `tasks.md` as single source of truth
- ✅ Created `activeContext.md` for session tracking
- ✅ Initialized `progress.md` (this file)

### Documentation Review
- ✅ Analyzed README.md
- ✅ Analyzed AGENT.md
- ✅ Analyzed EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md
- ✅ Analyzed TODO.md
- ✅ Reviewed custom_modes instructions (VAN mode)

### Project Assessment
- ✅ Complexity level determined: **Level 3**
- ✅ Mode progression path: VAN → PLAN → CREATIVE → IMPLEMENT → QA
- ✅ Technology stack validated: Graphiti + FalkorDB + Python 3.10+
- ✅ Timeline confirmed: 7-day pilot

**Completion Date**: 2025-10-15
**Completed By**: VAN mode initialization

## Phase 1: Schema & Models 🟢 MOSTLY COMPLETE

### Completed Tasks
- ✅ Define Pydantic entity models (9/10 entities: Document, DocVersion, Clause, AgentRecommendation, SuggestedEdit, Rationale, UserDecision, Concession, ReviewSession, Episode)
- ✅ Implement canonical ID generation (5 functions in models/ids.py)
- ✅ Create validation tests (tests/test_models.py with 6 test cases)

### Remaining Tasks
- [ ] Add Party entity model (missing from implementation)
- [ ] Normalize ground truth datasets (data dependency - coordinate with Liz)
- [ ] Create merge script (`scripts/ground_truth/merge_annotations.py`)
- [ ] Prepare smoke test dataset (1 matter, 4 versions)

### Blockers
- Ground truth data not yet available (external dependency)

### Notes
**Status**: 80% complete. Core models done, only Party entity and data preparation remain.

- ✅ Configuration loading from `.env`

### Remaining Tasks (🎨 **CREATIVE REQUIRED**)
- [ ] Environment setup (FalkorDB Docker, venv, pip install)
- [ ] Graphiti client wrapper implementation
- [ ] Episode creation strategy design (CREATIVE session)
- [ ] Node upsert functions (Document, DocVersion, Clause)
- [ ] Edge creation functions (11 edge types)
- [ ] Bi-temporal metadata management
- [ ] Rate limiting with SEMAPHORE_LIMIT
- [ ] Smoke test execution

### Dependencies
- Phase 1 Party entity (minor)
- FalkorDB Docker running (Day 1)
- Creative design session for episode strategy (Day 2)

### Blockers

## Phase 3: Retrieval & Query System 🟡 PARTIALLY STARTED

### Completed Tasks
- ✅ Query templates module created (`analytics/kpi_queries.py`)
- ✅ 4 Cypher query templates defined (clause_lineage, outstanding_recommendations, handover_snapshot, concession_trail)
- ✅ Query parameterization framework

### Remaining Tasks
- [ ] Graphiti retrieval gateway
- [ ] Query execution engine
- [ ] KPI calculation functions (precision/recall, adherence %, completeness %, latency)
- [ ] Result transformation and aggregation
- [ ] Query CLI tools (`scripts/analytics/run_kpis.py` - stub exists)

### Dependencies

### Blockers
None currently

### Notes
**Status**: 40% complete. Query templates ready, execution engine needed.

- **Future**: Selective CREATIVE mode for complex components, then IMPLEMENT

### Decision Points
1. **After Phase 1**: Proceed to Phase 2 or iterate on models?
2. **After Phase 4**: Execute Neptune evaluation (Phase 6)?
3. **After Phase 5**: Additional features or lock for production?

### Dependencies External to Project
- OpenAI API access (required)
- Docker environment (required)
- Ground truth dataset availability (TBD)
- AWS credentials for Neptune (optional, Phase 6 only)
