# Active Context

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-15
**Current Mode**: IMPLEMENT (Day 1 - COMPLETE ✅)
**Next Mode**: IMPLEMENT (Day 2 - Environment Setup + Graphiti Integration)
**Session**: Synthetic Data Generator Implementation Complete

---

## Current Focus
**✅ Day 1 COMPLETE**: Synthetic data generator implemented and validated. Generated 12 test files (3 matters × 4 versions) based on real contract patterns. ALL Day 2-7 development unblocked.

**🎯 NEXT**: Day 2 - Environment setup (FalkorDB Docker, dependencies) + begin Graphiti integration.

---

## Project Context

### What We're Building
A knowledge-graph-driven continuity layer for contract negotiations using:
- **Graphiti** (state-of-the-art memory retrieval system)
- **FalkorDB** (primary backend, Docker-based)
- **Optional Neptune** (AWS managed graph database for production evaluation)

### Why It Matters
Contract negotiations currently suffer from:
- Lost context during lawyer handovers
- Repeated prompts about already-decided issues
- Difficulty tracking concessions across versions
- No precedent search across matters
- Manual clause linkage between versions

### Key Metrics We're Targeting
1. **Clause linkage**: >90% precision, >85% recall
2. **Recommendation adherence**: >75% without repeat prompts
3. **Handover reliability**: >95% context completeness
4. **Concession visibility**: <2 minutes to locate

## Recent Progress
- ✅ VAN Mode: Memory Bank structure established, complexity assessed (Level 3)
- ✅ PLAN Mode: Implementation plan created (10 phases, 7 days)
- ✅ Documentation Reorganization: Clean project structure achieved
- ✅ CREATIVE Mode: User goals analyzed and enhancements designed
- ✅ CREATIVE Mode: 5 enhancements integrated into plan
- ✅ Base Contract Analysis: Extracted patterns from real Professional Services MSAs
- ✅ **Day 1 IMPLEMENT - Synthetic Data Generator** ⭐ CRITICAL PATH COMPLETE
  - Analyzed 3 real contract documents (96K+ characters)
  - Extracted negotiation patterns and decision distributions
  - Built comprehensive generator with 12 clause templates
  - Generated 12 test files: 3 matters × 4 versions
  - **Result**: 100+ clauses, 28 recommendations, 28 decisions, 2 concessions
  - **Files**: `data/ground_truth/synthetic/` (108 KB total)
  - **Documentation**: Complete README with usage examples
  - **Status**: ✅ ALL Day 2-7 development unblocked

## Immediate Next Steps

**🎯 NEXT: IMPLEMENT Mode - Day 2**

**Priority 1: Environment Setup** (2 hours)
- Start FalkorDB Docker container
- Install project dependencies (`pip install graphiti-core[falkordb]`)
- Configure `.env` file with OpenAI API key + FalkorDB connection
- Test connectivity

**Priority 2: Add Party Entity** (1 hour)
- Add missing `Party` Pydantic model to `models/entities.py`
- Update existing files to reference Party entity
- Add Party validation tests

**Priority 3: Begin Graphiti Integration** (5-7 hours)
- Load one synthetic matter (matter_001_v1.json)
- Implement basic ingestion to FalkorDB
- Verify nodes/edges created correctly
- Run simple query to retrieve clause

**Total Day 2**: 8-10 hours

**After Day 2**: Continue Graphiti integration (Day 2-3) with full ingestion pipeline

---

## Current Complexity Assessment
**Level 3: Moderately Complex**

**Reasoning:**
- Multi-component system (ingestion, retrieval, query, metrics)
- Knowledge graph integration with temporal modeling
- Multiple experiment scenarios to support
- KPI tracking and validation framework
- Production readiness considerations

**Mode Path**: VAN → PLAN → CREATIVE (for complex components) → IMPLEMENT → QA

- `graphiti-analysis-recommendations.md` - Implementation patterns

### Memory Bank
- `memory_bank/projectbrief.md` - Foundation document ✅
- `memory_bank/tasks.md` - Single source of truth ✅
- `memory_bank/activeContext.md` - Current focus (this file) ✅
- `memory_bank/progress.md` - Implementation status 🔄

### Implementation Areas (Not Yet Created)
- `models/` - Pydantic entity definitions
- `scripts/ingest/` - Graphiti ingestion pipeline
- `scripts/analytics/` - KPI query system
- `analytics/` - Query modules and retrieval gateway
- `data/ground_truth/` - Annotated contract versions

## Technical Context

### Environment Status
- Python 3.10+ required
- Virtual environment: Not yet created
- FalkorDB Docker: Not yet running
- Dependencies: Not yet installed
- `.env` configuration: Template exists (`.env.example`)

### Technology Decisions Made
- ✅ Graphiti selected over custom solution (94.8% benchmark performance)
- ✅ FalkorDB for prototype (single Docker command, $0 cost)
- ✅ Neptune evaluation optional (Day 5, production comparison)
- ✅ OpenAI API for embeddings and extraction
- ✅ Pydantic 2.0+ for entity validation

---

## Open Questions
- Ground truth dataset status (Are 3-5 matters with annotations ready?)
- Specific contract domain (NDAs, SaaS agreements, employment?)
- Existing extractor outputs location
- User preferences for CLI vs notebook experiments

---

## Memory Bank Workflow Notes
- VAN mode assesses complexity and determines next mode
- For Level 3, path is: VAN → PLAN → (selective) CREATIVE → IMPLEMENT
- Memory Bank files serve as shared context across modes
- tasks.md is the single source of truth for all task tracking
- Each mode updates relevant Memory Bank files upon completion

---

## Session Context
This is the first VAN mode invocation for the project. User triggered VAN mode with command "VAN", followed by request to initialize Memory Bank structure (command "1").

**VAN Mode Objective**: Assess project state, establish Memory Bank, determine mode progression path.

**Completion Criteria for VAN**:
- [x] Memory Bank structure initialized
- [x] Project complexity assessed (Level 3)
- [x] Mode progression determined (→ PLAN)
- [ ] Transition to PLAN mode when ready
